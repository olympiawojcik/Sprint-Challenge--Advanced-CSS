    The meta tag in HTML provides meta data about the HTML. Meta data is data that describes
    and gives info about other data. It's not displayed on the screen, but it is machine parsablle.
    They are used to specify title, author, last modified, etc.
    
    The browser's viewport is the window in which web content can be seen. The viewport varies with devices; 
    it's smaller on mobile and larger on desktop. However, the viewport is often NOT the same size as the
    rendered page.Without a viewport meta tag, mobile devices render pages at typical desktop screen widths, 
    and then scale the pages to fit the mobile screens, in which case the browser provides scrollbars for 
    the user to scroll around and access all of the content. 
    
    HTML5 introduced a method that lets web designers take control over the viewport through the meta tag. 
    This means  we can tell the browser to display your web property at the width of the device.
    
    
    It is madeup of 3 parts
    1. <meta> element gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling
    2. width=width-device sets the width of the page to the width of the device
    3. initial-scale=1.0 sets the initial zoom level

      <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

      <h3>Can We Visit Planets?</h3>
      <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet.</p>
      <p>Which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it.</p>

        <p>The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home that must be defended like a holy relic. The Earth was absolutely round.</p>
        <p>Suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth.</p>
